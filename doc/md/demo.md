# Demonstrations

The demo directory contains four different demonstrations:

- **Automotive**: demonstration of the `patternsOnNetwork` tool on a Automotive,
    double-priority communication bus with real time intervals and resources
    contention.
- **DATE_2018**: specification files used to produce the experimental results
    presented in the DATE 2018 paper.
- **LTLSpecs**: specification files used to exemplify the usage of the `chase`.
- **python_examples**: examples showing the usage of the Python API. 
- **Terraswarm**: demonstration of the `patternsOnNetwork` tool on an aircraft power
    distribution network without real time intervals in the specification.
    Presented at the *TerraSwarm Annual Meeting* held in Berkeley on the 
    26 and 27 October 2016.
- **Timing**: demonstration of the `patternsOnNetwork` tool on an aircraft power
    distribution network with real time intervals in the specification.


Each directory contains the specification of a set of benchmarks.
